### About
This is the first project of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree course. The program displays a webpage of different movies and clicking on the movie titles plays a popup of the movie trailer from a youtube link.


### Prerequisite
The project setup involved two steps:
  - Python: This project uses python to create site.
  - Source Code: It is available on [github]. You can clone the project using ```git clone``` command .Clone or download project directly from given repository in the instructor notes of project.


### Running
To generate the HTML file for the website, run the following .py file```(entertainment_show.py)```
This will generate a html file named ```fresh_tomatoes.html``` in the same folder or it will overwrite the existing one if already exits. Also it will open a new tab on default browser and load the generated page.

### Modules
There are three modules in the projects
  - ```entertainment_center.py:```it creates movie objects and then calls the movie generator to create html file
  - ```fresh_tomatoes.py```: this module creates the html for the website.
  - ```media.py```: It is the data model which defines a movie.
